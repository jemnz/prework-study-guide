Bootcamp pre-work study guide for students 


## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a webpage to provide basic notes for students to help them complete the prework-study guide. I built a webpage as it is easily accessible and will help students get through the course. In this webpage, we learnt about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Debugging and Git Hub.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
